// Array References:

// References means address in memory its means if we commpare one to--- 
// another one and if there value is also same but its always false 
// because the array References is different (New array means new References)

// let one = ['a'];
// let two = ['a'];

// one == two; (False)
// one === two; (False)

let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
let newarr = arr;

// now

// newarr == arr; (True);
// newarr === arr; (True);

// newarr == arr; (True);
// because we can do arr equal to newarr then its References is now same thats why its shows True
